Zebrahub data
In the Cell_Ranger directory, there is data for two samples, Day 5 (replicate TDR51) and Day 10 (replicate TDR71). The raw reads were downloaded from SRA and were processed with Cell Ranger. The output data in the filtered_feature_bc_matrix was subsampled to keep only 3000 cells for each sample. 

In the H5AD directory, there is data for the same two replicates. However, the processed h5ad files were used instead of the raw reads as in the Cell_Ranger directory. The h5ad files were downloaded from the Zebrahub Google Drive and then subsampled to keep only 3000 cells for each sample.
